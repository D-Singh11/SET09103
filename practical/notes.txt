to check the version of flas use : python -c "import flask"

we can create virtual environments with the assistanve of virtualenv called virtual environment. It will allow us to craete as many as virtualenvironments
within which we can install whatever packages we want.
-	Pacakegs installed inside the virtual environments are local to that environment and can not be accessed from outside it.
- 	It is useful if we want to run different versions of a package for different projects.

Always create difrernt virual environments to run differet versions of the same package :


to install virtual environment do :  sudo apt install virtualenv

to create virtual environment do : 	virtualenv "name of the environemnt it can be anything" e.g virtualenv  test

to activate virtual environment do : source python-enbv/test/activate

to install packages in the environment do : pip nam eof the package e.g pip flask

to check versin of flask or packaage : pip freeze

to deactivate virtual environment do : deactivate

to create something similar to package.json

always create a copy of all the packages installed in the virtual environment by doing pipo freeze > name of the file

then to install all those packages on othe machine do its same as npm run install : pip install -r name of the file


Best practise : create a folder 
	> create virtual envrionemnt 
	> create src folder for the source code 
	> create test folder for the test
	> cfreate docd folder for documents
	> install required packages
	> create a requirements file buy doing pip freeze
 ******* only push requirements file and source code to the github because user can install all the packages using that file.
